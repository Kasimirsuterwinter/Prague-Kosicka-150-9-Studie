# Vertical Village Studie for Prague Kosicka 150/9

This is a series of drawings, models and writings outlining an idea for a project. While walking through Prague 10, I came across this empty plot and immediately I was inspired to imagine it as a vertical village. As pedestrians walked up the existing stairs they would gain access to different ground floor levels. Each would be built as a solid foundation upon which any simple wooden framed houses, or commercial space could be built. As these smaller spaces would be largely decoupled from the built super structure of the whole building it would allow for long term adaptation and evolution.

I first studied this approach during my bachelors thesis project. I will be updating information here as my explorations progress.

Please feel free to get in touch with me if you have comments or questions. You are also welcome to fork the repo and add or explore your own ideas from this starting point.
